# Restaurant-POS - using .Net, Angular

### Developed fully by Numan, for company Icicle Corporation.
### Please note that, I have not added the project's source code to this repo, because that is Icicle's property. Only screenshots of the app are here so that you can see my work. 

### The app is a food management and restaurant POS app.
